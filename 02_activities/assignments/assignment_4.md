# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/).
Data link: 
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/cultural-festivals-funding-program-recipients/
  
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.

Visual 2:
stacked Bar Chart

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

For Python coding : I use matplotlib and Plotly for visualization 
For other I use Power BI and created visuals which are attached as a screen shot. If required I can share the saved PowerBI file.

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    
    Policy analsyst, stakeholders in cultural development and funding organizations
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    
    The bar chart highlights which recepients received the highest funding.  This visualization helps identify the most heavily funded programmes/projects and allows for comparison across receipents.
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 

    substantive: Clear labeling of receipents and funding/grant amount
    perceptal: color-coded bars to improve readability
    asesthetic: balanced use of color and axis limits for a clean layout.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 

    The Python code file name 'assignment_4.ipynb' is saved under 'participation' folder. Which can use to reproduce the visualization.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  

    Used high contrast colors and clear fonts for better readbility.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    
who is impacted: 
The recipients of the funding and decision-makers who allocate these funds.
Local communities and cultural organizations who benefit from increased visibility of funding disparities.

    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    
Feature Selection:

Excluded unnecessary details like administrative codes to focus on funding amounts and recipients. Highly focused on grant amount and type of project, project name and benifited wards. Which are the main interest area from the stakeholder point of view.
By combining Python and Power BI, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the dataset while addressing different stakeholder needs effectively.

    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
