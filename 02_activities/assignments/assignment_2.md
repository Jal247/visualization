# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Good Visualisation:

  Good Visualisation points:
      I think this data visualisation is good in terms of segmentation, clarity, and interactivity. 
1.	Clear Segmentation of Metrics:  The dashboard organizes key financial metrics such as Revenue, Total COGS, Gross Profit, and Net Profit in the top section, making it easy for users to quickly access high-level information.
2.	Variety of Visualizations:  Bar charts and line graphs are used to display trends over time, which are effective for showcasing changes and patterns.
3.	Color Usage:  The red and green color scheme is used to highlight performance metrics (e.g., gains vs. losses), making it intuitive for users to identify good and bad performance areas.
4.	Interactivity:  Filters on the left-hand side suggest that the dashboard allows users to customize the view, which is a best practice in dashboard design.
5.	Comprehensive Financial Breakdown:  The inclusion of different sections like "Assets & Liabilities" and "G&A Expenses" allows for a detailed understanding of financial performance.

Bad Visualisation:

Bad Visualization points: 
       I think this data visualization, is less effective because it lacks context, benchmarks, interactivity, and scalability for more complex data. It prioritizes look over functionality, limiting its practical application. 
1.	Lack of Context:  The gauges are presented without any contextual information about what the values represent. Without context, the data feels abstract and lacks actionable insights.
2.	Inefficient Use of Space:  Gauges occupy significant screen space but present limited information (a single value or percentage).
3.	Potential Misinterpretation:	Some designs use unconventional complex layouts that might confuse users unfamiliar with these formats.  The absence of scales on some gauges makes it harder to assess performance accurately.
4.	Limited Comparability:  Gauges are designed to display one value at a time, making it difficult to compare multiple metrics side by side.








      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
Answer for Good visualization:  
1.	Reduce visual clutter by removing unnecessary labels or grouping similar charts together.
2.	Simplify the color scheme by using muted tones with strategic highlights for critical metrics.
3.	Increase font sizes for charts to enhance readability.
4.	Add more contextual annotations to clarify what the numbers mean (e.g., targets or thresholds)


Answer for Bad visualization:
1.	Provide Context and Benchmarks:  Add labels or annotations explaining what each gauge represents (e.g., "NPS measures customer satisfaction"). Include benchmarks (e.g., targets or thresholds) to indicate whether the value displayed is positive, negative, or neutral.
2.	Use More Space-Efficient Alternatives:  Replace some gauges with compact visualizations like bar charts, progress bars, or bullet graphs that provide more information in less space.
3.	Add Comparison Metrics:  Use grouped or stacked bar charts to compare multiple metrics side by side instead of displaying individual gauges.
4.	Enhance Scalability:  If this were part of a dashboard, include interactivity (e.g., hover-over tooltips or drilldowns) so users can explore trends and details beyond a single value.
5.	Standardize the Layout:  Ensure that all gauges include consistent scales and labels to improve comparability and prevent misinterpretation.
6.	Highlight Practical Usage Scenarios:  Instead of simply showcasing designs, illustrate real-world use cases for each type of gauge.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
